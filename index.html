        // About<p>Before immersing myself in the world of technology, I spent three enriching years studying Filmmaking at the Northern Film School. During this immersive period, I collaborated with crews of around 20 fellow students to produce film projects each semester. The result? A collection of the best films that reflect my passion for storytelling and visual expression. <p>In addition to my love for technology and filmmaking, I find solace and joy in the tactile world of ceramics. This art form allows me to explore the intersection of precision and artistic expression, adding yet another layer to my creative pursuits.</p></p>

The film kicks off when Jim, a mild-mannered working class man, decides it's time to buy his first home, but is everything as it seems to be?</p></p><p>Reflection.</p><p>Being the creative producer for this film was a delightful ride into the absurd. Juggling the eccentricities of the script, I collaborated with a talented team to infuse humor and heart into every scene. Navigating unexpected challenges, we turned setbacks into creative opportunities. From refining comedic timing to fostering a joyful set atmosphere, the experience was a testament to the magic of collaboration, resulting in a film that brings laughter and whimsy to the screen.</p></div>

Set against the backdrop of an eccentric crowd of partygoers, the film delves into the complexities of belief and personal identity.</p></p><p>Reflection.</p>Producing this film amidst Covid-19 restrictions brought unique challenges, requiring us to adapt and find creative solutions. The limitations fostered a sense of resilience and innovation within the team, ensuring safety while maintaining artistic integrity.<p>Opting to shoot on a Kragnogorsk-3 16mm film camera added an authentic and nostalgic texture to the film. The deliberate choice echoed the thematic exploration of faith and reflection, infusing the visuals with a timeless quality that beautifully complemented the narrative. Despite the technical challenges, the decision to embrace analog filmmaking enriched the project, contributing to the film's overall emotional resonance.</p></div>

The process of transforming raw clay into unique, tangible pieces provides a therapeutic escape. With every turn of the wheel and molding of clay, I discover a serene balance between precision and artistic expression. Pottery has become a cherished outlet where I can immerse myself in the meditative act of creation, offering a delightful contrast to the fast-paced worlds of technology and filmmaking. Through the crafting of each piece, I not only shape the clay but also find a profound connection to the tangible beauty that emerges from my hands.</p><p>✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:*</p></div>

The decision to embark on the journey of acquiring and restoring this dormant kiln felt like uncovering a hidden treasure. Closer inspection revealed a significant challenge: the inner coils were damaged beyond repair, presenting an intricate puzzle that demanded both patience and technical finesse.</p><p>Undeterred by the coil's state, I eagerly embraced the opportunity to not only salvage the kiln but to elevate my technical skills in the process. The delicate task of replacing the coils became a hands-on lesson in craftsmanship and restoration, blending seamlessly with my love for pottery. Each coil replaced felt like a step towards rekindling the dormant potential of this forgotten kiln.</p><p>However, the restoration journey took an unexpected turn when I delved into troubleshooting the electronics. Unraveling the complexities of the kiln's electronic components added a layer of challenge, requiring further diagnostic exploration. As I navigate this uncharted territory, the kiln restoration project has evolved into a compelling fusion of technical problem-solving and artistic devotion, epitomizing my commitment to both the tangible beauty of pottery and the intricate world of kiln engineering.</p></div>
